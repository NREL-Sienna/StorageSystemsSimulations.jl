## About
`StorageSystemsSimulations.jl` is a [`PowerSimulations.jl`](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna/PowerSystems.jl) extension to support formulations and models related to energy storage. Operational Storage Models can have multiple combinations of different resitrctions. To manage these variations `StorageSystemsSimulations.jl` relies on the [PowerSimulations.DeviceModel](@extref) attributes feature. Formulations can have varying implementations for different attributes defined in [PowerSimulations.DeviceModel](@extref).

## Installation

The latest stable release of PowerSimulations can be installed using the Julia package manager with

```
(@v1.10) pkg> add PowerSimulations StorageSystemsSimulations
```

For the current development version, "checkout" this package with

```
(@v1.10) pkg> add PowerSimulations StorageSystemsSimulations#main
```

An appropriate optimization solver is required for running StorageSystemsSimulations models. Refer to [`JuMP.jl` solver's page](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/#Install-a-solver) to select the most appropriate for the application of interest.
